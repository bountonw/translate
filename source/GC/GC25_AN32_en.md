## {GC 693.1}

Page 435. A threefold message.—Revelation 14:6, 7 foretells the proclamation of the first angel’s message. Then the prophet continues: “There followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen.... and the third angel followed them.” The word here rendered “followed” means “to go along with,” “to follow one,” “go with him.” See Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, Greek English Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940), Vol. 1, p. 52. It also means “to accompany.” see George Abbott-Smith, A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament (Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1950), page 17. It is the same word that is used in Mark 5:24, “Jesus went with him; and much people followed Him, and thronged Him.” It is also used of the redeemed one hundred and forty-four thousand, Revelation 14:4, where it is said, “these are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.” In both these places it is evident that the idea intended to be conveyed is that of “going together,” “in company with.” So in 1 Corinthians 10:4, where we read of the children of Israel that “they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them,” the word “followed” is translated from the same Greek word, and the margin has it, “went with them.” From this we learn that the idea in Revelation 14:8, 9 is not simply that the second and third angels followed the first in point of time, but that they went with him. The three messages are but one threefold message. They are three only in the order of their rise. But having risen, they go on together and are inseparable. {GC 693.1}
