The Moniteur Officiel was the government paper at the time of the Revolution and is a primary source, containing a factual account of actions taken by the assemblies, full texts of the documents, etc. It has been reprinted. See also A. Aulard, Christianity and the French Revolution (London, 1927), in which the account is carried through 1802—an excellent study; W. H. Jervis, The Gallican Church and the Revolution (London, 1882), a careful work by an Anglican, but shows preference for Catholicism. {GC 688.5}
