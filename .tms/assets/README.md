# Lao Great Controversy

The files are located in `__GC_lo`

I started translating the Great Controversy into Lao using  Google Docs and was struggling without a termbase to keep track of terms. This led me to adopt an expensive CAT service online. I have exported everything from both the CAT service and Google Docs into corresponding folders. 


## __googledocs files

Chapters 1–3 have been edited multiple times and are ready to be exported from `__GC/__googledocs/__03_public/` into `*.md` files and put in the `lo/GC/03_public` folder. But I don't know an easy way to map what has already been translated into the segments that CAT created.

Chapters 4–6 are in the process of being edited and are ready to be exported from `__GC/__googledocs/__02_edit/` into `*.md` files and put in the `lo/GC/02_edit` folder. But I don't know an easy way to map what has already been translated into the segments that CAT created.

Chapters 7 has finished its raw translation, but was not imported to CAT. It needs to be exported from `__GC__googledocs/__01_raw/` into `*.md` format and put in `lo/GC/01_edit`

Chapters 21–42 have had the chapter title created. These need to be copied over to their respective `.md` files

## `__cat_01_raw`

Chapters 8–20. These are fully segmented translations. **They are all raw.** There are 3 files for each chapter. The `*-T-C.docx` files are clean target language files without segmentation. The `*-T.docx` files are `source-target` tabled files. The `*.mxliff` are Memsource XLIFF localization files and are in xml format. 

**Note:** Chapters 11 and 20 are incomplete a [** ] note indicates where my translation ends and the CAT machine translation begins. I think the wording of the notes is [** Translated to here], or something very similar to that.

Chapters 21–42 are found in the `__cat_segmented_but_unused` folder. These are fully segmented machine translations. They should be exported in a way to indicate that they are not raw translations, but a pre-phase.

## `__cat_translation_memory`

The `.tmx` file is in the **Translation Memory Exchange** format and is an xml file. This should be the Translation Memory of the book as currently updated.

There is a separate folder `.tms/assets/__translation_memory_EGW` that may be of interest. It contains everything I had done on the cat service in Thai, Mien, and Lao. There is a chance that I didn't write to the `GC_lo` TM and wrote to this instead.

## termbase

The termbase for this and other books and snipits are in the `.tmx/termbases/` folder. `EGW*.tbx` or `EGW*.xlsx` is the termbase that applies to Lao GC.

# Other Books

## Mien SC

The language code for Mien is `ium` for **Iu Mien**. I have completed translation for chapter one of _Steps to Christ_ using the online CAT service. Chapter 1 needs to be exported to `ium/SC/01_raw`.
