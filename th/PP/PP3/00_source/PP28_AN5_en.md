## {PP 760.3}

Note 5. Page 329. The Ten Commandments were the “covenant” to which the Lord referred when, in proposing a covenant with Israel, He said, “If ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant,” etc. Exodus 19:5. The ten commandments were termed God’s “covenant” before the covenant was made with Israel. They were not an agreement made, but something which God commanded them to perform. Thus the Ten Commandments—God’s covenant—became the basis of the covenant made between Him and Israel. The Ten Commandments in all their details are “all these words,” concerning which the covenant was made. See Exodus 24:8. {PP 760.3}
