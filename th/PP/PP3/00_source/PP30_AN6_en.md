## {PP 761.1}

Note 6. Page 354. When a sin offering was presented for a priest or for the whole congregation, the blood was carried into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil and placed upon the horns of the Golden Altar. The fat was consumed upon the altar of burnt offering in the court, but the body of the victim was burned without the camp. See Leviticus 4:1-21. {PP 761.1}

## {PP 761.2}

When, however, the offering was for a ruler or for one of the people, the blood was not taken into the holy place, but the flesh was to be eaten by the priest, as the Lord directed Moses: “The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: In a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.” Leviticus 6:26, R.V. See also Leviticus 4:22-35. {PP 761.2}
