## {1SM 121.1}

### ความจำเป็นเร่งด่วนของคริสตจักร

ในหมู่พวกเรา การฟื้นฟูจิตวิญญาณให้สอดคล้องกับพระลักษณะของพระเจ้าอย่างแท้จริงเป็นสิ่งที่จำเป็นและเร่งด่วนที่สุด การแสวงหาสิ่งนี้ควรเป็นงานอันดับแรกของเรา เราต้องพยายามอย่างจริงจังเพื่อรับพระพรจากองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้า ไม่ใช่เพราะพระองค์ไม่เต็มพระทัยที่จะประทานพระพรแก่เรา แต่เพราะเรายังไม่พร้อมที่จะรับพระพรนั้นต่างหาก พระบิดาของเราทรงเต็มพระทัยที่จะประทานพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์แก่ผู้ที่ทูลขอ มากยิ่งกว่าที่พ่อแม่ในโลกจะให้ของขวัญดีๆ แก่ลูกๆ ของตน แต่เป็นหน้าที่ของเราที่จะสารภาพบาป ถ่อมใจลง กลับใจใหม่ และอธิษฐานอย่างจริงจัง เพื่อให้เป็นไปตามเงื่อนไขที่พระเจ้าทรงสัญญาว่าจะประทานพระพรแก่เรา การฟื้นฟูจะเกิดขึ้นได้ก็ต่อเมื่อเราอธิษฐานขอเท่านั้น ในขณะที่ผู้คนขาดพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์ของพระเจ้าอย่างที่เป็นอยู่นี้ พวกเขาไม่สามารถซาบซึ้งในคำเทศนาที่ตรงตามพระวจนะได้ แต่เมื่อฤทธิ์เดชของพระวิญญาณสัมผัสจิตใจของพวกเขา คำเทศนาจะเกิดผลอย่างแน่นอน เมื่อคนที่มาร่วมประชุมของเราใช้วิจารณญาณอย่างรอบคอบตามการชี้นำจากพระวจนะ และการสำแดงของพระวิญญาณ พวกเขาจะได้รับประสบการณ์อันล้ำค่า และเมื่อกลับบ้านไป ก็จะพร้อมที่จะส่งผลดีต่อคนรอบข้าง {1SM 121.1}

## {1SM 122.1}

ผู้นำรุ่นเก่าที่เคยชูธงแห่งความเชื่อมีประสบการณ์ในการทุ่มเทจิตใจอธิษฐานเสมือนเป็นการปล้ำสู้กับพระเจ้า และพระองค์ทรงเทพระวิญญาณของพระองค์ให้แก่พวกเขา แต่คนเหล่านี้กำลังล้มหายตายจากไปทีละคน แล้วใครเล่าจะมาแทนที่พวกเขา คนรุ่นใหม่ละ พวกเขาได้มอบถวายชีวิตแด่พระเจ้าอย่างแท้จริงแล้วหรือยัง เราตื่นตัวกับงานที่กำลังดำเนินอยู่ในพลับพลาบนสวรรค์หรือไม่ หรือเรากำลังรอให้มีอำนาจบางอย่างมากระตุ้นคริสตจักรก่อนเราถึงจะตื่นขึ้น เรากำลังหวังที่จะเห็นสมาชิกคริสตจักรทั้งหมดฟื้นฟูขึ้นอีกครั้งหรือเปล่า จะไม่มีวันนั้น {1SM 122.1}

## {1SM 122.2}

There are persons in the church who are not converted, and who will not unite in earnest, prevailing prayer. We must enter upon the work individually. We must pray more, and talk less. Iniquity abounds, and the people must be taught not to be satisfied with a form of godliness without the spirit and power. If we are intent upon searching our own hearts, putting away our sins, and correcting our evil tendencies, our souls will not be lifted up unto vanity; we shall be distrustful of ourselves, having an abiding sense that our sufficiency is of God. {1SM 122.2}

## {1SM 122.3}

We have far more to fear from within than from without. The hindrances to strength and success are far greater from the church itself than from the world. Unbelievers have a right to expect that those who profess to be keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, will do more than any other class to promote and honor, by their consistent lives, by their godly example and their active influence, the cause which they represent. But how often have the professed advocates of the truth proved the greatest obstacle to its advancement! The unbelief indulged, the doubts expressed, the darkness cherished, encourage the presence of evil angels, and open the way for the accomplishment of Satan's devices. {1SM 122.3}

## {1SM 122.4}

### Opening the Door to the Adversary

The adversary of souls is not permitted to read the thoughts of men; but he is a keen observer, and he marks the words; he takes account of actions, and skillfully adapts his temptations to meet the cases of those who place  themselves in his power. If we would labor to repress sinful thoughts and feelings, giving them no expression in words or actions, Satan would be defeated; for he could not prepare his specious temptations to meet the case. {1SM 122.4}

## {1SM 123.1}

But how often do professed Christians, by their lack of self-control, open the door to the adversary of souls! Divisions, and even bitter dissensions which would disgrace any worldly community, are common in the churches, because there is so little effort to control wrong feelings, and to repress every word that Satan can take advantage of. As soon as an alienation of feeling arises, the matter is spread before Satan for his inspection, and the opportunity given for him to use his serpentlike wisdom and skill in dividing and destroying the church. There is great loss in every dissension. Personal friends of both parties take sides with their respective favorites, and thus the breach is widened. A house divided against itself cannot stand. Criminations and recriminations are engendered and multiplied. Satan and his angels are actively at work to secure a harvest from seed thus sown. {1SM 123.1}

## {1SM 123.2}

Worldlings look on, and jeeringly exclaim, “Behold how these Christians hate one another! If this is religion, we do not want it.” And they look upon themselves and their irreligious characters with great satisfaction. Thus they are confirmed in their impenitence, and Satan exults at his success. {1SM 123.2}

## {1SM 123.3}

The great deceiver has prepared his wiles for every soul that is not braced for trial and guarded by constant prayer and living faith. As ministers, as Christians, we must work to take the stumbling blocks out of the way. We must remove every obstacle. Let us confess and forsake every sin, that the way of the Lord may be prepared, that He may come into our assemblies and impart His rich grace. The world, the flesh, and the devil must be overcome. {1SM 123.3}

## {1SM 123.4}

We cannot prepare the way by gaining the friendship of the world, which is enmity with God; but by His help we can break its seductive influence upon ourselves and upon others. We cannot individually or as a body secure  ourselves from the constant temptations of a relentless and determined foe; but in the strength of Jesus we can resist them. {1SM 123.4}

## {1SM 124.1}

From every member of the church a steady light may shine forth before the world, so that they shall not be led to inquire, What do these people more than others? There can be and must be a withdrawal from conformity to the world, a shunning of all appearance of evil, so that no occasion shall be given for gainsayers. We cannot escape reproach; it will come; but we should be very careful that we are not reproached for our own sins or follies, but for Christ's sake. {1SM 124.1}

## {1SM 124.2}

There is nothing that Satan fears so much as that the people of God shall clear the way by removing every hindrance, so that the Lord can pour out His Spirit upon a languishing church and an impenitent congregation. If Satan had his way, there would never be another awakening, great or small, to the end of time. But we are not ignorant of his devices. It is possible to resist his power. When the way is prepared for the Spirit of God, the blessing will come. Satan can no more hinder a shower of blessing from descending upon God's people than he can close the windows of heaven that rain cannot come upon the earth. Wicked men and devils cannot hinder the work of God, or shut out His presence from the assemblies of His people, if they will, with subdued, contrite hearts, confess and put away their sins, and in faith claim His promises. Every temptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret, may be successfully resisted, “not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts” (Zechariah 4:6). {1SM 124.2}

## {1SM 124.3}

### We Are in the Day of Atonement

We are in the great day of atonement, when our sins are, by confession and repentance, to go beforehand to judgment. God does not now accept a tame, spiritless testimony from His ministers. Such a testimony would not be present truth. The message for this time must be meat in due season to feed the church of God. But Satan has been  seeking gradually to rob this message of its power, that the people may not be prepared to stand in the day of the Lord. {1SM 124.3}

## {1SM 125.1}

In 1844 our great High Priest entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, to begin the work of the investigative judgment. The cases of the righteous dead have been passing in review before God. When that work shall be completed, judgment is to be pronounced upon the living. How precious, how important are these solemn moments! Each of us has a case pending in the court of heaven. We are individually to be judged according to the deeds done in the body. In the typical service, when the work of atonement was performed by the high priest in the most holy place of the earthly sanctuary, the people were required to afflict their souls before God, and confess their sins, that they might be atoned for and blotted out. Will any less be required of us in this antitypical day of atonement, when Christ in the sanctuary above is pleading in behalf of His people, and the final, irrevocable decision is to be pronounced upon every case? {1SM 125.1}

## {1SM 125.2}

What is our condition in this fearful and solemn time? Alas, what pride is prevailing in the church, what hypocrisy, what deception, what love of dress, frivolity, and amusement, what desire for the supremacy! All these sins have clouded the mind, so that eternal things have not been discerned. Shall we not search the Scriptures, that we may know where we are in this world's history? Shall we not become intelligent in regard to the work that is being accomplished for us at this time, and the position that we as sinners should occupy while this work of atonement is going forward? If we have any regard for our souls’ salvation, we must make a decided change. We must seek the Lord with true penitence; we must with deep contrition of soul confess our sins, that they may be blotted out. {1SM 125.2}

## {1SM 125.3}

We must no longer remain upon the enchanted ground. We are fast approaching the close of our probation. Let every soul inquire, How do I stand before God? We know not how soon our names may be taken into the lips of Christ, and our cases be finally decided. What, oh, what  will these decisions be! Shall we be counted with the righteous, or shall we be numbered with the wicked? {1SM 125.3}

## {1SM 126.1}

### The Church to Arise and Repent

Let the church arise, and repent of her backslidings before God. Let the watchmen awake, and give the trumpet a certain sound. It is a definite warning that we have to proclaim. God commands His servants, “Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins” (Isaiah 58:1). The attention of the people must be gained; unless this can be done, all effort is useless; though an angel from heaven should come down and speak to them, his words would do no more good than if he were speaking into the cold ear of death. {1SM 126.1}

## {1SM 126.2}

The church must arouse to action. The Spirit of God can never come in until she prepares the way. There should be earnest searching of heart. There should be united, persevering prayer, and through faith a claiming of the promises of God. There should be, not a clothing of the body with sackcloth, as in ancient times, but a deep humiliation of soul. We have not the first reason for self-congratulation and self-exaltation. We should humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. He will appear to comfort and bless the true seekers. {1SM 126.2}

## {1SM 126.3}

The work is before us; will we engage in it? We must work fast, we must go steadily forward. We must be preparing for the great day of the Lord. We have no time to lose, no time to be engaged in selfish purposes. The world is to be warned. What are we doing as individuals to bring the light before others? God has left to every man his work; every one has a part to act, and we cannot neglect this work except at the peril of our souls. {1SM 126.3}

## {1SM 126.4}

O my brethren, will you grieve the Holy Spirit, and cause it to depart? Will you shut out the blessed Saviour, because you are unprepared for His presence? Will you leave souls to perish without the knowledge of the truth, because you love your ease too well to bear the burden that Jesus bore for you? Let us awake out of sleep. “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Peter 5:8). {1SM 126.4}

## {1SM 127.1}

### Reformation Accompanies Revival

In many hearts there seems to be scarcely a breath of spiritual life. This makes me very sad. I fear that aggressive warfare against the world, the flesh, and the devil has not been maintained. Shall we cheer on, by a half-dead Christianity, the selfish, covetous spirit of the world, sharing its ungodliness and smiling on its falsehood?—Nay! By the grace of God let us be steadfast to the principles of truth, holding firm to the end the beginning of our confidence. We are to be “not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord” (Romans 12:11). One is our Master, even Christ. To Him we are to look. From Him we are to receive our wisdom. By His grace we are to preserve our integrity, standing before God in meekness and contrition, and representing Him to the world. {1SM 127.1}

## {1SM 127.2}

Sermons have been in great demand in our churches. The members have depended upon pulpit declamations instead of on the Holy Spirit. Uncalled for and unused, the spiritual gifts bestowed on them have dwindled into feebleness. If the ministers would go forth into new fields, the members would be obliged to bear responsibilities, and by use their capabilities would increase. {1SM 127.2}

## {1SM 127.3}

God brings against ministers and people the heavy charge of spiritual feebleness, saying, “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see” (Revelation 3:15-18).  God calls for a spiritual revival and a spiritual reformation. Unless this takes place, those who are lukewarm will continue to grow more abhorrent to the Lord, until He will refuse to acknowledge them as His children. {1SM 127.3}

## {1SM 128.1}

A revival and a reformation must take place, under the ministration of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two different things. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual death. Reformation signifies a reorganization, a change in ideas and theories, habits and practices. Reformation will not bring forth the good fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the revival of the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work, and in doing this work they must blend. {1SM 128.1}

## {1SM 128.2}

### Simple Agencies Will Be Used

Representations have been made to me, showing that the Lord will carry out His plans through a variety of ways and instruments. It is not alone the most talented, not alone those who hold high positions of trust, or are the most highly educated from a worldly point of view, whom the Lord uses to do His grand and holy work of soulsaving. He will use simple means; He will use many who have had few advantages to help in carrying forward His work. He will, by the use of simple means, bring those who possess property and lands to a belief of the truth, and these will be influenced to become the Lord's helping hand in the advancement of His work. {1SM 128.2}
